# Agent context

Durable context for this repo lives in `docs/`. Read it before assuming;
it is the record, and this file is only the pointer to it.

- `docs/qna/` — answers indexed by the question you would ask again
- `docs/plans/` — implementation plans
- `docs/journal/` — dated record of what happened
- `docs/design/` — the design still in force

## Repository Architecture & Guidelines
- Domain engineering guidelines, commenting standards, and safety constraints
  are defined in `.agents/AGENTS.md`.
- Repo-specific procedures and skills are located in `.agents/skills/`.

## Machine Wiring
`.agents/` holds machine wiring and local skills. A hook cannot install itself
and a missing hook fails silently.
- If the `agents` CLI is installed, run `agents doctor` early and report any warnings before relying on this context.
- If `agents` is not installed on this machine, skip machine wiring checks and adhere directly to the repository instructions above.

Recording is covered by the global instruction and the `recording-what-you-learn`
skill; it is not repo-specific and is not restated here.
